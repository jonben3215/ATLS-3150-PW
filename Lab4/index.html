        <h2 id="Ghosts">Famous Ghosts</h2>
        <p> <strong>Pausanias</strong> - The famous Spartan general Pausanias, victor over the Persians at the sea battle of Plataea in 479 BC, 
          continued to make waves after his death â€“ as a ghost, possibly the most famous ghost of the ancient world.</p>
        <p><strong>The Bingen Poltergeist</strong>- According to the story, the ghost would start fires in the crops and farm buildings, throw stones maliciously, 
          shake the farmhouse, and even shout at the farmer accusing him of having affairs with young women.</p>
        <p><strong>Anne Boleyn</strong> - Over the centuries her ghost has been seen in many places around Britain, including the Tower of London, 
          Windsor Castle, Blickling Hall, and Anneâ€™s childhood home of Hever Castle in Kent.</p>
        <p><strong>The Drummer of Tedworth</strong> - The haunting continued for months and included beds being thrown about, fetid smells, strange lights, scratching, and even the sounds of dogs and cats. 
          The troublesome ghost attacked guests, servants, a local blacksmith, and even Mompessonâ€™s horse, which was reported to have died of fright. 
          The ghostâ€™s voice was heard and Mompesson even claimed to have seen it.</p>
        <p><strong>The Cock Lane Ghost</strong> - At a house in Cock Lane, Smithfield, a poltergeist was reported to be terrorising the inhabitants. The ghost made loud knocking noises and the household claimed they had seen the phantom with their own eyes.</p>
        <p><strong> The Bell Witch </strong> - Starting with mysterious scratching and rapping sounds, it moved on to furniture being shoved about, bedclothes being violently thrown off, and physical assault including slapping and pinching.</p>
        <p><strong> The Maharajah Duleep Singh</strong> - I went to bed, leaving, as I always do, a bright light in the room (electric light). 
          As I lay in bed I found myself looking at an oleograph which hung on the wall opposite my bed. 
          I saw distinctly the face of my father, the Maharajah Duleep Singh, looking at me, as it were, out of this picture; not like a portrait of him, but his real head.
        </p>
        <p><strong> Abraham Lincoln </strong> - Over the years several occupants of the famous Washington building have 
          reported seeing the phantom of the murdered leader, including Theodore Roosevelt, Grace Coolidge, 
          and visitors such as Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands (who fainted on seeing Lincolnâ€™s phantom).</p>

    <h2>Vampires</h2>
    <p><strong> Plogojowitz</strong> - Peter Plogojowitz was a Serbian peasant who died in 1725, and was thought to be a vampire by the villagers. 
      Not long after he was buried, people claimed Peter visited them at night, with some of them dying not too long after. 
      Even Peterâ€™s own son died from massive blood loss days after he claimed to have been visited.</p>
    <p><strong> Arnold Paole</strong> - before his death in 1726, he claimed to have been bitten by a vampireâ€”an event that left him feeling cursed.
      After his death from a farming accident a short time later, people in the village began dying, and all fingers pointed to the recently deceased Paole.</p>
    <p><strong>Lord Ruthven</strong> - Lord Ruthven is an aristocratic, and suave nobleman who can capture womenâ€™s attentionâ€”which is a pity for them since his preference for victims are pure and innocent women.</p>
    <p><strong>Carmilla</strong> - What sets Carmilla apart from others is the fact that she does not just take a victim and drain their blood in one sitting. She first earns their trust, and even shows signs loveâ€”but 
      itâ€™s the type of love becomes possessive, which turns to obsession, and eventually kills the one she is focused on.</p>
    <p><strong>JCountess Elizabeth BÃ¡thory de Ecsed</strong> - Elizabeth BÃ¡thory is attributed with torturing and murdering young servant and peasant women (most of whom went to her castle in hopes of a better life, and employment). 
      Elizabethâ€™s tortures included jamming needles under fingernails, stabbing, biting areas of the body, burning with hot-irons (or other metals, like coins), beatings, starvation, and more. 
      She would reportedly bathe in her victimsâ€™ blood so to keep her youthful features and prolong her life. The total body count of Elizabethâ€™s victims comes to an estimated 175 to over 200. </p>

    <h2>Demons</h2>
    <p><strong>Aamon</strong> - According to the Dictionnaire Infernal by Collin de Plancy, he commands 40 legions of demons and carries the title of Prince. He's also an entity many looked to reconcile friends and foes, and procure love for those seeking it. The Egyptians viewed Amon or Amun as their supreme God; 
      they represented him with the blue skin, in a rather human form.</p>
    <p><strong>Barong</strong> - Barong is a panther-like creature and character in the Balinese mythology of Bali, Indonesia. He is the king of the spirits, leader of the hosts of good, and enemy of Rangda, the demon queen and mother of all spirit guarders in the mythological traditions of Bali. </p>
    <p><strong>Satan</strong> - Satan,[a] also known as the Devil,[b] and sometimes also called Lucifer in Christianity, is an entity in Abrahamic religions that seduces humans into sin or falsehood. In Judaism, Satan is seen as an agent subservient to God, typically regarded as a metaphor for the yetzer hara, or "evil inclination". </p>
    <p><strong>Yan-gant-y-tan</strong> - Yan-gant-y-tan wanders the nights in FinistÃ¨re. He holds five candles on the five fingers of his right hand (compare Hand of Glory) and spins them about like a flaming wheel, as a result of which he is unable to turn quickly for fear of extinguishing their light. </p>
    <p><strong>Surgat</strong> - Surgat (Latin: Surgat, lit.â€‰'Rise') is a minor demon mentioned in The Grimoire of Pope Honorius,[1] The Secrets of Solomon and the Grimorium Verum. He is listed as "Surgat who opens all locks." His angel opposite is Aquiel.[2]</p>
