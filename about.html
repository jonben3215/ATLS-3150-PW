      <ul>
        <li>I recreated a wiki for a famous mobile game called Clash of Clans.
           This game was and still is a very popular game that was developed by the company SuperCell. 
           During its time of release back in 2012 it was the buzz. Here you can read all about the history 
           and the rise of the game and what made is so popular and addicting. However for this assingment we didn't really do much 
          accessibility work, it was just so students can get a little warmup with html and css.</li>

      <ul>
        <li style="color: black;">For this lab I created a website about cats. Majority of the infromation was from WIKI, the point of this project wasn't about recreating another wiki page. I was to help understand the usage of Google Icons, the use of different fonts, the ability of creating a more readable tale that screen readers and actually read from. In addition, in this lab we were taught about how to make forms and how to have users click and type their information. </li>

     <ul>
      <li style="color:black">Since Holloween was the week after this assignment I decided to create a website using Grid to display users all iconic ghosts, vampire, and Demons that are present in movies, histories, or in holy scripters like the Bible. Some of these ghosts, demons, and vampire included, Plogojowitz, Satan, and Pausanias. All of which have great history as being feared by people.</li>

     <ul>
      <li style="color:black">Created a final project that "marketed" Universal design. 
        My final project specififcally talked about what is universal deisgn, why it is important, 
        and how we practice or implement universal design in apps and website so people that are disabled and abled
         bodies can all use the website with no problems. All while using Grids, thumable navigation, color contrast, and many more 
        techniques to ensure that the website is accessible to all different users.</li>
