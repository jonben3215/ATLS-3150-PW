    <h2>Why Should Companies Care?</h2>
   <p>Universal Design reinforces a company's commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR), 
    demonstrating a genuine concern for societal well-being. By prioritizing inclusivity in their offerings, businesses 
    not only contribute to societal progress but also foster a culture of empathy and understanding within their organization. 
    This approach enhances employee morale and satisfaction, promoting a positive work environment centered around diversity 
    and empathy.</p>
